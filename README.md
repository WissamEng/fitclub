This project is a web app that allows users to sign up to fitness classes. The app will allow users to view the classes available, sign up to classes, and view their upcoming classes. The app will also allow the admin to view the users that have signed up to classes. Users can login/logout and see and edit their profile. The admin can add classes, edit classes, delete classes, view users, and view classes data. The site features a home page, a classes page, a calendar, a sign up page, a login page, a profile page, user photos, a blog, an about us page and an admin page.
